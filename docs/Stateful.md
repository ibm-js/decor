# delite/Stateful

delite/Stateful allows you to define a class with a set of properties,
and to define custom getters/setters for some (or all, or none) of those properties:

	MyClass = dcl(Stateful, {
		label: "Press",
		_setLabelAttr: function(val){
			this._set("label", ...);
			...
		}
	});

Then application code can instantiate instances of that class, and set and retrieve its properties
using standard notation:

	var myWidget = new MyClass();
	myWidget.label = "hello";
	console.log(myWidget.label);

Application code can also watch for changes to [a subset of] the instance properties:

	myWidget.watch("label", callback);


## Implementation notes

Ideally ES5 native accessors would be supported via [dcl](http://www.dcljs.org/) but we are
[still waiting for that](https://github.com/uhop/dcl/issues/2).  They aren't supported
by [ComposeJS](https://github.com/kriszyp/compose) either, although Kitson has
[a branch](https://github.com/kitsonk/core/blob/master/compose.js#L373) that supports them,
so using his branch is another option, if we could live with ComposeJS's limited features like
lack of C3MRO.


As for implementing watch(), we would ideally use
[Object.observe()](http://updates.html5rocks.com/2012/11/Respond-to-change-with-Object-observe)
or some similar functionality like
[Firefox's watch() method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/watch)
or [IE's onpropertychange listener](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/ms536956.aspx).
Unfortunately there is no support for any of these on current versions of Webkit.  Even when Webkit starts
to support Object.observe() in its production release (ie: without needing to flip a switch to
"turn on experimental features"), it will be a while before the change trickles down to the mobile devices
we want to support.

Polymer tries to polyfill this functionality with it's [observe-js](https://github.com/Polymer/observe-js)
library.  However, after changing an object property (or set of object properties) the app needs to call
`Platform.performMicroTaskCheckpoint()`, or a similar method like `observer.deliver()`, so this hardly seems
like an acceptable solution.

So, the implementation is that delite/Stateful will note all the properties defined in the prototype, direct and inherited,
and call Object.defineProperty() on the prototype to add native ES5 setters and getters for those properties.
For properties where the subclass doesn't define a custom setter, Stateful will generate one on-the-fly
that just calls this._set(...) to save the new value and announce the change to any listeners registered
via watch().
