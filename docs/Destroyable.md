# decor/Destroyable

Decor/Destroyable is used to track handles of an instance, and then destroy them when the instance is destroyed.
The application must call destroy() on the instance in order to release the handles.

Destroyable is one of the superclasses of `delite/Widget`.

Example:

```js
var DestroyableSubClass = dcl(Destroyable, {
	constructor: function(aStatefulObject, aPromise){
		var d = new Deferred();

		this.own(
			// observe changes to aStatefulObject (automatically stop observing when I'm destroyed)
			aStatefulObject.observe("x", function(oldVals){ ... }),

			// create a supporting (internal) widget, to be destroyed when I'm destroyed
			new MySupportingWidget(...),

			// execute code when promise completes, but cancel promise if I am destroyed
			d.then(myFunc)
		);
	}
});
```
